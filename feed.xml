<p>There are times when being a digital packrat comes in handy, this was one.  I’ve had several old GPG keys floating around that I no longer used.  Well, let’s be clear I never really use GPG, I just keep working with it since I find it interesting and it may actually come in handy one day.</p>

<p>I was able to find the old keyring and send out revocations for all of the old ones and update the keyservers that are still active with my current one.</p>

<p>And while I was at it, I did a bit of clean-up on keybase though it’s essentially a zombie site at this point.  While searching for alternatives I came across <a href="https://keyoxide.org/">keyoxide</a> which seems to be the best way to link different accounts under a verifiable identity at this point.  That’s all configured for now and I setup <a href="https://wiki.gnupg.org/WKD">Web Key Directory entries</a> on this site.</p>]]></content><author><name>Eddie McCreary</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Are you the Gatekeeper?]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Same as it ever was</title><link href="http://localhost:8000/2022/11/11/Same-as-it-ever-was/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Same as it ever was" /><published>2022-11-11T02:20:06-06:00</published><updated>2022-11-11T02:20:06-06:00</updated><id>http://localhost:8000/2022/11/11/Same-as-it-ever-was</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:8000/2022/11/11/Same-as-it-ever-was/"><![CDATA[<p>A bit of house keeping, still not finding the time to update pages despite my best intentions.</p>]]></content><author><name>Eddie McCreary</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A bit of house keeping, still not finding the time to update pages despite my best intentions.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Rocket Firing Boba Fett</title><link href="http://localhost:8000/2021/08/16/Rocket-Firing-Boba-Fett/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Rocket Firing Boba Fett" /><published>2021-08-16T07:56:55-05:00</published><updated>2021-08-16T07:56:55-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:8000/2021/08/16/Rocket-Firing-Boba-Fett</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:8000/2021/08/16/Rocket-Firing-Boba-Fett/"><![CDATA[<p>Yes, they don’t really exists, until now.  In 1978 up to 100 prototype rocket firing Boba Fett action figures were made until several children were injured and one killed by the rocket from the rocket firing Colonial Viper toy.

<p>Bootleg figures were recently produced and I couldn’t help getting a J and L model.</p>

<p>I’m powering it right now with a small 12V DC power adapter intended for use with LED strips.  However it may be underpowered, the Arduino seems to
