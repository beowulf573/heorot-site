In 1978 up to 100 prototype rocket firing Boba Fett action figures were made until several children were injured and one killed by the rocket from the rocket firing Colonial Viper toy.  Kenner quickly shifted gears and fixed the rocket to the jetpack.

Bootleg figures were recently produced and I couldn't help getting a J and L model.

----------------

I wasted a lot of time trying to come up with a custom theme, in the end I decided to just steal^H^H^H^H^Hborrow one
from [Kyle Stratis](http://kylestratis.com/2015/05/05/blog-setup-pt2/).

That way something would be updated in century.]]></content><author><name>Eddie McCreary</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Borrowed Theme]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Dome Drive</title><link href="http://localhost:8000/2018/08/21/dome-drive/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Dome Drive" /><published>2018-08-21T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-08-21T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:8000/2018/08/21/dome-drive</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:8000/2018/08/21/dome-drive/"><![CDATA[Finally, something is moving on the R2.

The gear is taken from [Media Conversions](http://r2d2.media-conversions.net/), I took the basic dxf file, imported it into Fusion 360, extruded it, and
chopped it up using a jigsaw type connection so each piece would fit on my print bed.  So far I'm very happy with the result.

I'm powering it right now with a small 12V DC power adapter intended for use with LED strips.  However it may be underpowered, the Arduino seems to 
reset after continuous use.  The DC motor may be pulling too many amps.]]></content><author><name>Eddie McCreary</name></author><category term="r2d2" /><category term="dome" /><category term="astromech" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Finally, something is moving on the R2.
